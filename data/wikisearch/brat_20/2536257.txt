A working holiday visa is a residence permit allowing travellers to undertake employment (and sometimes study) in the country issuing the visa to supplement their travel funds. For many young people, holding a working holiday visa enables them to experience living in a foreign country without undergoing the usual costly expenses of finding work sponsorship in advance or going on expensive university exchange programmes.
Most working holiday visas are offered under reciprocal agreements between certain countries to encourage travel and cultural exchange between their citizens.
There are often several restrictions on this type of visa:
Many are intended for young travellers and, as such, have an age restriction (usually from 18 to 30 or 35).
There are usually limits on the type of employment taken or the length of time the traveller can be employed.
The visa holder is expected to have sufficient funds to live on while employment is sought.
The visa holder should have some kind of health or travel insurance for the duration of the stay unless the country will cover.
