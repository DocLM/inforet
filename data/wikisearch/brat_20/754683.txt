The Danish Gymnasium offers a 3-year general academically-oriented upper secondary programme which builds on the 9th-10th form of the Folkeskole and leads to the upper secondary school exit examination (the studentereksamen). This qualifies a student for admission to higher education Preparatory, subject to the special entrance regulations applying to the individual higher education programmes. Colloquially gymnasium refers to what is formally called STX.
Apart from the common academic gymnasium, there are other types of occupation-oriented upper secondary education in Denmark. The main ones are højere handelseksamen or HHX ("Higher Commercial Examination Programme"), højere teknisk eksamen or HTX ("Higher Technical Examination Programme"), and højere forberedelseseksamen or HF ("Higher Preparatory Examination Programme").
