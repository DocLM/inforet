Air pollution sensors are devices that detect and monitor the presence of air pollution in the surrounding area. They can be used for both indoor and outdoor environments. These sensors can be built at home, or bought from certain manufactures. Although there are various types of air pollution sensors, and some are specialized in certain aspects, the majority focuses on five components: ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrous oxide. The sensors were very expensive in the past, but with technological advancements these sensors are becoming more affordable and more widespread throughout the population. These sensors can help serve many purposes and help bring attention to environmental issues beyond the scope of the human eye.
The EPA maintains a repository of air quality data through the Air Quality System (AQS), where it stores data from over 10,000 monitors in the United States.
While use of these sensors was expensive in the past, the 2010s saw a recent trend towards the development of cheaper portable air-quality sensors that can be worn by individuals to monitor local air quality levels. These sensors, can then, in turn, help measure the spatiotemporal coverage and variety of chemical species, and empower individuals and communities to better understand their exposure environments and risks from air pollution.
A research group led by William Griswold at UCSD handed out portable air pollution sensors to 16 commuters, and found "urban valleys" where buildings trapped pollution. The group also found that passengers in buses have higher exposures compared to those in automobiles.
