Yisrael Beiteinu (Hebrew: יִשְׂרָאֵל בֵּיתֵנוּ‬, lit. Israel Our Home) is a secularist and right-wing nationalist political party in Israel. The party's base has traditionally been secular, Russian-speaking Israelis. The party describes itself as "a national movement with the clear vision to follow in the bold path of Zev Jabotinsky", the founder of Revisionist Zionism. It primarily represents immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Although it has attempted to expand its appeal to more established Israelis, it has not been successful, and most of its voters are Russian-speaking. It takes a strong line towards the peace process and the integration of Israeli Arabs, characterized by its 2009 election slogan "No loyalty, no citizenship". Its main platform includes a recognition of the two-state solution, the creation of a Palestinian state that would include an exchange of some largely Arab-inhabited parts of Israel for largely Jewish-inhabited parts of the West Bank. The party maintains an anti-clerical mantle and encourages socio-economic opportunities for new immigrants, in conjunction with efforts to increase Jewish immigration. In the 2009 election the party won 15 seats, its most to date, making it the third largest party in the previous Knesset. In the 2015 election, the party won six seats.
