A disproportionate number of notable people have suffered from some form of mood disorder. This is a list of people accompanied by verifiable source associating them with bipolar disorder (formerly known as "manic depression") based on their own public statements; this discussion is sometimes tied to the larger topic of creativity and mental illness. In the case of dead people only, individuals with a speculative or retrospective diagnosis should only be listed if they are accompanied by a source reflective of the mainstream, academic view. Individuals should not be added to this list unless the disorder is regularly and commonly mentioned in mainstream, reliable sources.
