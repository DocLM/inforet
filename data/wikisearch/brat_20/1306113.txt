The Government of Spain (Spanish: Gobierno de Espa√±a) is the central government which leads the executive branch and the General State Administration of Spain. The Government consists of the Parliament (Cortes Generales) and more precisely of the Congress of the Deputies, a body which invests the President or ceases him through the motion of censure. This is because Spain is a parliamentary system established by the Constitution of 1978.
Its fundamental regulation is placed in Title IV of the Constitution, as well as in Title V of that document, with respect to its relationship with the Cortes Generales, and in Law 50/1997, of November 27, of the Government.
According to Article 97 of the Constitution and Article 1.1 of the Government Act, "the Government directs domestic and foreign policy, the civil and military administration and the defense of the State. It exercises the executive function and the regulatory regulation according to the Constitution and the laws".
