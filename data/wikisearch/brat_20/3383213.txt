Reefer Madness is a musical satire of the 1936 cult classic Reefer Madness that opened in Los Angeles in 1998. The book and lyrics were written by Kevin Murphy and the book and music by Dan Studney. Directed by Andy Fickman, it was initially shown at the Hudson Theater on Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles and then moved to the New York City "Off-Broadway" scene. The show opened Off Broadway on September 15, 2001, and closed shortly thereafter. Rodgers and Hammerstein Theatricals now administers the stock/amateur rights, and the show has been produced by local theater groups in several cities, including Toronto, Seattle, Philadelphia, Charleston, Sacramento, Raleigh, Norfolk, Minneapolis, and London. The 2008 production at Washington, D.C.'s Studio Theater won two Helen Hayes Awards (directing and outstanding Resident Production).
The Canadian premiere was produced by Hart House Theatre in September 2006 with both Kevin Murphy and Dan Studney in attendance. The show returns to Canada during The Lower Ossington Theatre's Toronto production, June 9â€“18, 2011. The show made its Australian debut in Sydney on July 24, 2008 and UK premiere in London on March 24, 2009.
A film adaptation of the same name by Fickman, Murphy and Studney themselves was made in 2005, with several actors reprising their roles.
