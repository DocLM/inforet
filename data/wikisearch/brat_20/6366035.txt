Transport in Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, is defined by various factors. These include the shape of the Auckland isthmus (with its harbours often creating chokepoints and long distances for land transport), the suburban character of much of the urban area, a history (since World War II) of focusing investment on roading projects rather than public transport and high car-ownership rates.
These factors have contributed to a transport system that is highly dependent on private motor vehicles. Several motorways radiating to the north, northwest, southwest and south act as the backbone of the city's road network, with the busiest section of motorway carrying over 200,000 vehicles a day. Public transport use in Auckland was high until the 1950s but subsequently declined during the second half of the 20th century, before experiencing a strong resurgence over the past 15 years. With the motorway network now largely completed, major efforts are underway to increase public transport use to address Auckland's congestion. Recent efforts have also focused on making cycling a safer and more attractive transport option.
Auckland has New Zealand's largest commercial port (mostly used for international commerce) and the country's largest international airport. It also has the Southern Hemisphere's largest marina.
