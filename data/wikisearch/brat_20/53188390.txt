Though they are not closely related to major Canadian Metropolitan Areas, the quality of mostly rural Northern Alberta is poorer than areas of similar population densities in Canada. Toronto and other Canadian municipalities face environmental problems associated with air pollution due to industrial chemicals.
Air pollution is Canada continues to negatively affect the environment, leading to an increase in health problems for Canadians, especially regarding leukemia. Air pollution has increased the rate of hospital visits per year and is currently causing premature deaths.
