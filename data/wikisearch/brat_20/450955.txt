Gun laws in Australia are mainly the jurisdiction of the country's states and territories, with the importation of guns regulated by the Federal Government.
A person who possesses or uses a firearm must have a firearm licence. Licence holders must demonstrate a "genuine reason" for holding a firearm licence and must not be a "prohibited person". All firearms in Australia must be registered by serial number to the owner, who also holds a firearms licence.
Firearms were introduced into Australia with European settlement on 26 January 1788. The colony of New South Wales was initially a penal settlement, with the military garrison being armed. Firearms were also used for hunting, protection of persons and crops, in crime and fighting crime, and in many military engagements. In the last two decades of the twentieth century, following several high-profile killing sprees, the Federal Government coordinated more restrictive firearms legislation with all state governments. Gun laws were largely aligned in 1996 by the National Firearms Agreement.
Numerous studies on the effects of Australia's gun laws have concluded that the laws have been effective in reducing mass shootings, gun suicides and armed crime, while other studies have argued that the laws have had little effect. Polling shows strong support for gun legislation in Australia with around 85-90% of people wanting the same or greater level of restrictions.
