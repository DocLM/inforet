In the United States, the non-medical use of cannabis is decriminalized in 13 states (plus the U.S. Virgin Islands), and legalized in another 9 states (plus the District of Columbia), as of January 2018. "Decriminalization" refers to a policy in which individuals caught possessing small amounts of cannabis will not face criminal prosecution, and instead will be subject to only some type of lesser civil penalty (often similar to how a minor traffic violation is treated). In jurisdictions without any such penalties, the policy is referred to as legalization, although the term decriminalization is sometimes broadly used for this purpose as well.
In 1972, the federally-appointed Shafer Commission examined the issue of rising cannabis use in America, and recommended that a policy of decriminalization be adopted. This helped influence 11 states to decriminalize cannabis during the 1970s, beginning with the state of Oregon in 1973. By the end of the decade, however, the tide had turned strongly in the other direction, and no state would decriminalize again until 2001.
In 2012, Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize cannabis, both by way of ballot initiative. Several states followed in 2014 and 2016, and in 2018 Vermont became the first to legalize through an act of state legislature. All jurisdictions that have legalized cannabis allow for its commercial distribution, except Vermont and the District of Columbia. All allow for personal cultivation, except Washington state.
At the federal level, cannabis remains prohibited for any use under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. The Justice Department has generally not enforced federal law in states that have legalized cannabis, under the guidance of the Cole Memorandum that was adopted in August 2013. In January 2018, however, the Cole memo was rescinded by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, granting U.S. Attorneys the ability to enforce federal law without restriction.
