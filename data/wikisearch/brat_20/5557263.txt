John Saris (c. 1580 â€“ 1643) was the captain of the first English voyage to Japan, in 1613, on board the Clove. As chief factor of the British East India Company's trading post in Java, Saris' mission was primarily one of seeking trade. Saris had started his career under command Henry Middleton on the company's second voyage to Asia.
