The Nazi gun control theory is counterfactual history, which is a form of history that attempts to answer "what if" questions known as counterfactuals. According to this theory, the gun regulations enforced by the Third Reich rendered victims of the Holocaust weaker to such an extent that they could have more effectively resisted oppression if they had been armed or better armed.
This theory is prevalent and primarily used within U.S. gun politics. Questions about its validity, and about the motives behind its inception, have been raised by scholars. Proponents in the United States have used it as part of a "security against tyranny" argument, while opponents have referred to it as a form of Reductio ad Hitlerum. Various mainstream sources describe the theory as historically "dubious", "questionable", "preposterous," "tendentious", and "problematic".
