The State of Texas is considered to have some of the most constitutionally adherent gun laws in the United States. Public concerns over gun control in Texas have increased in recent years as Mexican drug cartels continue to commit violent crimes closer to Texas' stretch of the Mexicoâ€“United States border.
The debate over gun control laws generally produces three arguments:
Those who believe gun control laws are effective in reducing gun-related accidents and crime and should be enforced by the government.
Those who believe gun control laws are ineffective in reducing gun-related accidents and crime and thus support fewer gun control measures.
Those who believe that the private ownership of guns reduces crime.
