Everytown for Gun Safety is an American nonprofit organization which advocates for gun control and against gun violence. Everytown was founded in 2014, combining 'Mayors Against Illegal Guns' and 'Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America'. Everytown for Gun Safety is largely bankrolled by Michael Bloomberg, who also founded the group.
The organization works to "support efforts to educate policy makers, as well the press and the public, about the consequences of gun violence and promote efforts to keep guns out of the hands of criminals." Most recently the group has focused on efforts to require universal background checks on firearms purchases. The organization also produces research and studies on gun violence.
