Gun legislation in Canada is largely about licensing and registration. Handgun registration became law in 1934, and automatic firearms registration was added in 1951. In 1969, laws classified firearms as "non-restricted", "restricted" and "prohibited". Starting in 1979, individuals who wished to acquire firearms were required to obtain a firearms acquisition certificate (FAC) from their local police agency. From 1995 to 2012, all firearms owners were required to possess a firearms licence (either a PAL, POL, FAC or a minors licence) and all firearms were required to be registered. In April 2012, the requirement to register non-restricted firearms was dropped in every province and territory, except for Quebec; the requirement for all firearms owners to possess a valid firearms licence remains law. In 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled against Quebec, entirely eliminating non-restricted registry records.
