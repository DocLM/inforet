Ninth grade (called Grade 9 in some regions) is the ninth post-kindergarten year of school education in some school systems. Ninth grade is often the first school year of high school in the United States. Students are usually 14â€“15 years old. In the United States, it is often called Freshman year. In England and Wales, the equivalent educational year is Year Ten. In Scotland the equivalent educational year is Third Year or S3, as this is the third year of compulsory secondary schooling.
