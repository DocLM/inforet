The National Gun Victims Action Council (NGVAC) is an American organization which advocates against gun violence and for gun control. The NGVAC uses targeted boycotts of various businesses and organizations in an attempt to persuade those organizations into changing their gun policies, or advocate for increased gun control. NGAC is based in Chicago, Illinois, and headed by Elliot Fineman, who "became active in gun control causes after his son was shot and killed in a San Diego restaurant in 2006 by a mentally ill man wielding a legally purchased handgun."
